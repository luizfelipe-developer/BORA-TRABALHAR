# User Profile Page

This project showcases a user profile page with basic data editing fields, implemented using a minimal set of tools to demonstrate fundamental concepts.

## Technologies Used:
- Visual Studio Code
- JavaScript
- CSS3
- HTML5
- Bootstrap

## About the Project:

The project is built following the standard structure for personal profiles commonly seen on the internet. It incorporates Bootstrap classes to achieve a blurred effect with opacity. 

Regarding data storage, all information is saved in Local Storage. This means that even if you update parts of the form with blank fields, the previously entered data will be retained unless intentionally replaced. The user can also change their profile picture by clicking on the image logo, and the new image will be stored in Local Storage.

### Note: Project Execution
To run the project, the "Live Server" extension in VSCode was utilized to set up a local server for testing the page.
